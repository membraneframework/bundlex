Bundlex is a multi-platform tool for compiling C code along with elixir projects, for use in NIFs and CNodes. The tool provides also convenient way of accessing compiled code in elixir modules.

This tool is a part of [Membrane Framework](https://membraneframework.org/)

## Instalation

To install, you need to configure Mix project as follows:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Mixfile do
  use Mix.Project

  def project do
    [
      app: :my_app,
      compilers: [:bundlex] ++ Mix.compilers, # add bundlex to compilers
      deps: deps(),
      # ...
   ]
  end

  defp deps() do
    [
      {:bundlex, "~> 3.0"} # add bundlex to deps
    ]
  end
end
```

and create `bundlex.exs` file in the project root folder, containing bundlex project module:

```elixir
defmodule Membrane.Element.Mad.BundlexProject do
  use Bundlex.Project

  def project() do
    []
  end
end
```

Now your project does not contain any C sources, but should compile successfully, and some bundlex messages should be printed while compilation proceeds.

## Usage

### Adding natives to project

Adding natives can be done in `project/0` function of bundlex project module in the following way:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.BundlexProject do
  use Bundlex.Project

  def project() do
    [
      nifs: nifs(Bundlex.platform),
      cnodes: cnodes(),
      libs: libs(),
      ports: ports()
    ]
  end

  defp nifs(:linux) do
    [
      my_nif: [
        sources: ["something.c", "linux_specific.c"]
      ],
      my_other_nif: [
        # ...
      ]
    ]
  end

  defp nifs(_platform) do
    [
      my_nif: [
        sources: ["something.c", "multiplatform.c"]
      ],
      my_other_nif: [
        # ...
      ]
    ]
  end

  defp cnodes() do
    [
      my_cnode: [
        sources: ["something.c", "something_other.c"]
      ],
      my_other_cnode: [
        # ...
      ]
    ]
  end

  defp ports() do 
    [
      my_port: [
        sources: ["something.c", "something_other.c"]
      ],
      my_other_port: [
        # ...
      ]
    ]
  end

  defp libs() do
    [
      my_lib: [
        sources: ["something.c", "something_other.c"]
      ],
      my_other_lib: [
        # ...
      ]
    ]
  end
end
```

As we can see, there are three types of natives:
- NIFs - dynamically linked to the Erlang VM (see [Erlang docs](http://erlang.org/doc/man/erl_nif.html))
- CNodes - executed as separate OS processes, accessed through sockets (see [Erlang docs](http://erlang.org/doc/man/ei_connect.html))
- libs - can be used by other natives as dependencies (see `deps` option below)
- ports - executed as separate OS processes (see [Elixir Port docs](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Port.html))

The sources should reside in `project_root/c_src/my_app` directory (this can be changed with `src_base` option, see below).

Configuration of each native may contain following options:
* `sources` - C files to be compiled (at least one must be provided),
* `includes` - Paths to look for header files (empty list by default).
* `lib_dirs` - Absolute paths to look for libraries (empty list by default).
* `libs` - Names of libraries to link (empty list by default).
* `pkg_configs` - Names of libraries for which the appropriate flags will be
obtained using pkg-config (empty list by default).
* `deps` - Dependencies in the form of `{app, lib_name}`, where `app`
is the application name of the dependency, and `lib_name` is the name of lib
specified in bundlex project of this dependency.
* `src_base` - Native files should reside in `project_root/c_src/<src_base>`
(application name by default).
* `compiler_flags` - Custom flags for compiler.
* `linker_flags` - Custom flags for linker.
* `language` - Language of native. `:c` or `:cpp` may be chosen (`:c` by default)

### Compilation options

The following command line arguments can be passed:
- `--store-scripts` - if set, shell scripts are stored in the project
root folder for further analysis.

### Loading NIFs in modules

NIFs compiled with Bundlex can be loaded the same way as any other NIFs (see [`:erlang.load_nif/2`](http://erlang.org/doc/man/erlang.html#load_nif-2)), but Bundlex provides `Bundlex.Loader` module to save you some boilerplate:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.SomeNativeStuff do
  use Bundlex.Loader, nif: :my_nif

  def normal_function(a, b, c, d) do
    private_native_function(a+b, c+d)
  end

  defnif native_function(a, b)

  defnifp private_native_function(x, y)

end
```

Note that unlike when using `:erlang.load_nif/2`, here `def`s and `defp`s can be used to create usual functions, native ones are declared with `defnif` and `defnifp`. This is achieved by creating a new module under the hood, and that is why module passed to C macro `ERL_NIF_INIT` has to be succeeded by `.Nif`, i.e.
```C
ERL_NIF_INIT(MyApp.SomeNativeStuff.Nif, funs, load, NULL, upgrade, unload)
```

In spite of this, any native erlang macros and functions shall be used as usual, as described at http://erlang.org/doc/man/erl_nif.html

### Interacting with CNodes

As in case of NIFs, CNodes compiled with Bundlex can be used like any other CNodes (see built-in `Node` module), while some useful stuff for interacting with them is provided. `Bundlex.CNode` module contains utilities that make it easier to spawn and control CNodes, and allow to treat them more like usual Elixir processes. Check out documentation for more details.
